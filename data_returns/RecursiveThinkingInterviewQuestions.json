We said we would say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it was not. Nature is lethal but it does not hold a candle to man. Look, just because I do not be giving no man a foot massage do not make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a glass motherfucking house, fucking up the way the nigger talks.
